* Alabaster Themes for Emacs

A collection of minimal light and dark themes for GNU Emacs based on the original Sublime Text Alabaster color scheme.

* Screenshots

*TODO*: Add screenshots of all five theme variants

* Overview

The Alabaster themes follow a minimal highlighting philosophy. Unlike most color schemes that highlight everything they can (ending up looking like a fireworks show), Alabaster uses minimal highlighting with just a few carefully chosen color classes.

** Design Principles

1. *Minimal Highlighting*: Only four main syntax classes are highlighted:
   - Strings
   - Constants (numbers, symbols, keywords, boolean values)
   - Comments
   - Global definitions

2. *No Keyword Highlighting*: Standard language keywords (if, else, function, etc.) are not highlighted. They are usually the least important and most obvious part of any program.

3. *Comment Highlighting*: Comments are highlighted prominently. If code was complex enough to deserve an explanation, then it's that explanation we should see and read first.

4. *No Font Variations*: The themes avoid mixing normal, bold, and italic text, making code easier to scan. Not all fonts provide bold/italic variants.

5. *Reliable Parsing*: Only highlights things that the parser can identify reliably. Unreliable highlighting does more harm than good.

6. *Conscious Color Usage*: With minimal rules, you can consciously use colors to look for specific information. All strings pop out because there aren't many other highlighted elements competing for attention.

* Philosophy and Design Evolution

** Relationship to Original Alabaster

This Emacs implementation is *inspired by* the original Sublime Text Alabaster color scheme, but has evolved to balance minimalism with modern Emacs user expectations.

** Adherence to Original Philosophy

We maintain these core principles:
- ✓ Only 4 syntax classes highlighted (strings, constants, comments, global definitions)
- ✓ Comments highlighted prominently in red (not dimmed)
- ✓ Keywords, types, and builtins use default text color (not highlighted)
- ✓ Conscious, restrained color usage
- ✓ Reliable parser-based highlighting

** Divergences from Original Philosophy

To support modern Emacs workflows, we made pragmatic compromises:

1. *Font Variations*: The original avoids bold/italic entirely. We use them sparingly for UI emphasis (headings, errors, Magit headers) - 95 of 506 faces inherit bold/italic.

2. *Package Support*: Original had ~40 faces for core syntax only. We provide 506 faces supporting 30+ packages (Magit, Org, Dired, etc.) for a consistent UI experience.

3. *Keywords in Some Variants*:
   - =alabaster= and =alabaster-dark=: Keywords use =fg-main= (black/white) - compliant
   - =alabaster-bg=: Comments use yellow instead of red - partially divergent
   - =alabaster-mono= and =alabaster-dark-mono=: Everything monochrome except errors - most compliant

** Which Variant Should You Use?

- For *pure minimalism* closest to original: Use =alabaster-mono= or =alabaster-dark-mono=
- For *balanced minimalism* with rich UI theming: Use =alabaster= or =alabaster-dark=
- For *background highlighting* instead of text: Use =alabaster-bg= (My Favourite!)

*** For Sublime Alabaster Purists

If you want the closest experience to the original:
- Use =alabaster-mono= or =alabaster-dark-mono=
- Set =(setq alabaster-themes-no-bold t)=
- These variants have minimal highlighting

For the full modern Emacs experience:
- Use =alabaster= or =alabaster-dark=
- Enjoy comprehensive package support

* Theme Variants

The package includes five theme variants:

| Theme                 | Description                              | Background Mode |
|-----------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------|
| =alabaster=           | Light theme with foreground highlighting | light           |
| =alabaster-bg=        | Light theme with background highlighting | light           |
| =alabaster-dark=      | Dark theme with foreground highlighting  | dark            |
| =alabaster-mono=      | Light monochromatic theme                | light           |
| =alabaster-dark-mono= | Dark monochromatic theme                 | dark            |


* Installation

** Requirements

- Emacs 28.1 or later

** Installation via package.el (TBD)

The themes will be available on MELPA. Install with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x package-install RET alabaster-themes RET
#+end_src

** Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the package
2. Add the directory to your =load-path=
3. Load the main file: =(require 'alabaster-themes)=

* Usage

** Interactive Commands

All commands are autoloaded and available after installing the package.

*** Theme Selection

- =alabaster-themes-select= : Select any Alabaster theme with completion. With a prefix argument, you can limit the selection to light or dark variants.

*** Palette Preview

- =alabaster-themes-list-colors= : Preview the color palette of any theme

With a prefix argument, preview only the semantic color mappings.

** Customization Options

*** Heading Styles

Control the appearance of headings (like in Org mode):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq alabaster-themes-headings
      '((1 light variable-pitch 1.5)  ; Level 1: light weight, variable-pitch, 1.5x height
        (2 regular 1.3)               ; Level 2: regular weight, 1.3x height
        (3 1.1)                       ; Level 3: 1.1x height
        (agenda-date 1.3)             ; Org agenda dates
        (agenda-structure variable-pitch light 1.8)  ; Org agenda structure
        (t variable-pitch)))          ; Default for all other levels
#+end_src

Properties you can set:
- =variable-pitch=: Use proportionally-spaced font
- Weight symbols: =thin=, =ultralight=, =extralight=, =light=, =semilight=, =regular=, =medium=, =semibold=, =bold=, =extrabold=, =ultrabold=
- Height: Floating-point number (e.g., 1.5) or =(height . FLOAT)=

*** Font Options

**Mixed Fonts**

Enable inheritance from =fixed-pitch= in spacing-sensitive constructs (Org tables, code blocks):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq alabaster-themes-mixed-fonts t)
#+end_src

**Variable Pitch UI**

Use proportional fonts in UI elements (mode line, header line, tab bar):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq alabaster-themes-variable-pitch-ui t)
#+end_src

*** Palette Overrides

**Common Overrides**

Override colors across all Alabaster themes:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq alabaster-themes-common-palette-overrides
      '((bg-main . "#FAFAFA")
        (fg-main . "#111111")))
#+end_src

**Per-Theme Overrides**

Override colors for a specific theme:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq alabaster-palette-overrides
      '((cursor . "#FF0000")
        (blue . "#0066CC")))
#+end_src

Available for all themes: =alabaster-palette-overrides=, =alabaster-bg-palette-overrides=, =alabaster-dark-palette-overrides=, =alabaster-mono-palette-overrides=, =alabaster-dark-mono-palette-overrides=

*** Post-Load Hook

Run code after loading a theme:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'alabaster-themes-post-load-hook
          (lambda ()
            (message "Alabaster theme loaded!")))
#+end_src

* Package Support

* Troubleshooting

** Colors look wrong or incomplete

- Ensure the theme is loaded properly: =(load-theme 'alabaster t)=
- Check for conflicting themes: =(custom-enabled-themes)=
- Try disabling other themes: =(mapc #'disable-theme (custom-enabled-themes))=

** Customizations not applying

- Use =M-x customize-group RET alabaster-themes RET= to set options
- Or set variables before loading the theme
- Some changes require reloading the theme

** Package faces not themed

- Ensure the package is loaded after the theme
- Some packages require restarting Emacs after theme changes
- Check if the package face is in the theme: =M-x describe-face RET <face-name> RET=
