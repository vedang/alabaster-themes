* Alabaster Themes for Emacs

A collection of minimal light and dark themes for GNU Emacs based on the original Sublime Text Alabaster color scheme.

* Overview

The Alabaster themes follow a minimal highlighting philosophy. Unlike most color schemes that highlight everything they can (ending up looking like a fireworks show), Alabaster uses minimal highlighting with just a few carefully chosen color classes.

** Design Principles

1. *Minimal Highlighting*: Only four main syntax classes are highlighted:
   - Strings
   - Constants (numbers, symbols, keywords, boolean values)
   - Comments
   - Global definitions

2. *No Keyword Highlighting*: Standard language keywords (if, else, function, etc.) are not highlighted. They are usually the least important and most obvious part of any program.

3. *Comment Highlighting*: Comments are highlighted prominently. If code was complex enough to deserve an explanation, then it's that explanation we should see and read first.

4. *No Font Variations*: The themes avoid mixing normal, bold, and italic text, making code easier to scan. Not all fonts provide bold/italic variants.

5. *Reliable Parsing*: Only highlights things that the parser can identify reliably. Unreliable highlighting does more harm than good.

6. *Conscious Color Usage*: With minimal rules, you can consciously use colors to look for specific information. All strings pop out because there aren't many other highlighted elements competing for attention.

* Philosophy and Design Evolution

** Relationship to Original Alabaster

This Emacs implementation is *inspired by* the original Sublime Text Alabaster color scheme, but has evolved to balance minimalism with modern Emacs user expectations.

** Adherence to Original Philosophy

We maintain these core principles:
- ✓ Only 4 syntax classes highlighted (strings, constants, comments, global definitions)
- ✓ Comments highlighted prominently in red (not dimmed)
- ✓ Keywords, types, and builtins use default text color (not highlighted)
- ✓ Conscious, restrained color usage
- ✓ Reliable parser-based highlighting

** Divergences from Original Philosophy

To support modern Emacs workflows, we made pragmatic compromises:

1. *Font Variations*: The original avoids bold/italic entirely. We use them sparingly for UI emphasis (headings, errors, Magit headers) - 95 of 506 faces inherit bold/italic.

2. *Package Support*: We provide 506 faces supporting 30+ packages (Magit, Org, Dired, etc.) for a consistent UI experience.

3. *Keywords in Some Variants*:
   - =alabaster-themes-light= and =alabaster-themes-dark=: Keywords use =fg-main= (black/white) - compliant
   - =alabaster-themes-light-bg=: Comments use yellow instead of red - partially divergent
   - =alabaster-themes-light-mono= and =alabaster-themes-dark-mono=: Everything monochrome except errors - most compliant

** Which Variant Should You Use?

- For *pure minimalism* closest to original: Use =alabaster-themes-light-mono= or =alabaster-themes-dark-mono=
- For *balanced minimalism* with rich UI theming: Use =alabaster-themes-light= or =alabaster-themes-dark=
- For *background highlighting* instead of text: Use =alabaster-themes-light-bg= (My Favourite!)

*** For Sublime Alabaster Purists

If you want the closest experience to the original:
- Use =alabaster-themes-light-mono= or =alabaster-themes-dark-mono=
- Set =(setq alabaster-themes-no-bold t)=
- These variants have minimal highlighting

For the full modern Emacs experience:
- Use =alabaster-themes-light= or =alabaster-themes-dark=
- Enjoy comprehensive package support

* Theme Variants

The package includes five theme variants:

| Theme                        | Description                              | Background Mode |
|------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------|
| =alabaster-themes-light=      | Light theme with foreground highlighting | light           |
| =alabaster-themes-light-bg=   | Light theme with background highlighting | light           |
| =alabaster-themes-dark=       | Dark theme with foreground highlighting  | dark            |
| =alabaster-themes-light-mono= | Light monochromatic theme                | light           |
| =alabaster-themes-dark-mono=  | Dark monochromatic theme                 | dark            |
